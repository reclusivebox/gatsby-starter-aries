# Aries Template ♈

    This is a Gatsby template that contains the following features:

- Storybook.

- Typescript support.

- Sass suport.

- Sitemap generation.

- `robots.txt` generation.

## Caveats

- When using CSS/SASS modules you can't import them with default imports, you need to do something like `import * as styles from 'yourFile.module.css'`.
